## ⚔️ `git fetch` vs `git pull`

| Command | What it does | When to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `git fetch` | **Downloads** changes from remote, **does not merge or update** your branch | When you want to **review** changes first |
| `git pull` | Does `git fetch` **+** automatically **merges** changes into your current branch | When you’re ready to **update your branch** |

---

## 🔍 1. `git fetch` – Download only

- Connects to the remote and **downloads new commits, branches, tags**, etc.
- **Does NOT change** your working directory.
- Keeps your local branch **unchanged**, but updates remote-tracking branches like `origin/main`.

### Example:

```bash
git fetch origin

```

Then inspect:

```bash
git diff main origin/main

```

You can manually merge after inspecting:

```bash
git merge origin/main

```

---

## 🔄 2. `git pull` – Fetch + Merge (or Rebase)

- First **fetches** the remote changes
- Then **automatically merges** them into your current branch

### Example:

```bash
git pull origin main

```

This updates your `main` branch with `origin/main`.

You can also configure `git pull` to use **rebase** instead of merge:

```bash
git pull --rebase

```

## 🧠 Summary Table

| Feature | `git fetch` | `git pull` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Downloads remote data | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Updates current branch | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (merge or rebase) |
| Safe to use anytime | ✅ Yes (read-only) | ⚠️ Might cause conflicts |

## 🔐 When to Use Which?

- ✅ Use `git fetch` when:
    - You want to **review** incoming changes first
    - You're working in a **team** and want to **avoid accidental merges**
    - You're using a **rebase-based workflow**
- ✅ Use `git pull` when:
    - You're working solo
    - You want to **quickly update** your branch

## üîÅ Example Scenarios

### ‚úÖ When to **Fork**:

You want to contribute to an open-source project (you **don't have write access** to the original repo).

**Steps**:

1. Go to GitHub and **fork** the repo.
2. Clone your fork:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/their-repo.git
    
    ```
    
3. Work on it.
4. Push changes to **your fork**.
5. Submit a **pull request** to the original repo.

### ‚úÖ When to **Clone**:

You have **read or write access** to a repo (your own project or a team repo).

**Steps**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/their-username/their-repo.git

```

Then make changes, commit, and push back (if you have permission).

# Git rebase

### 🚀 What Is `git rebase`?

`git rebase` is a **way to move your work** (commits) to a new starting point. It **replays your changes** on top of another branch — as if you made your changes later.

Think of it like **cutting your changes**, going back in time, and then **pasting them** on a new base.

---

### 🧠 Simple Analogy

Imagine you're writing a story (your commits), and your friend also wrote a story at the same time (another branch). Now you want your story to be based on your friend's version — **as if you started from their work instead of your own original starting point**.

---

### 🪜 Example: Before Rebase

You have this:

```
main:       A---B---C
                \
feature:         D---E

```

- A, B, C: commits on `main`
- D, E: your commits on `feature` branch (started from B)

Now `main` has moved forward (C). You want your `feature` branch to include that change **before** your commits.

---

### 🔁 After Rebase

```bash
git checkout feature
git rebase main

```

Now Git **moves D and E** to be **on top of C**:

```
main:       A---B---C
                        \
feature (rebased):       D'--E'

```

D and E are now **new commits (D', E')**, but with the same changes, just applied on top of C.

---

### 🎯 Why Use `git rebase`?

- To **clean up history** (linear instead of branching).
- To **avoid merge commits** (tidier project history).
- To **update your branch** with the latest changes from `main` or any base branch.

### ⚠️ Warning

Don’t rebase **public/shared branches** (like `main`) that others are using — it changes commit history!

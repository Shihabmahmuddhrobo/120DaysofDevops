# Git switch

`git switch` is a **modern Git command** used to **switch between branches** or **create a new one and switch to it**. It’s easier and more intuitive than the older `git checkout` for handling branches.

### ✅ Basic Usage of `git switch`

```

### 🔍 Why `git switch`?

Git 2.23+ introduced `git switch` (and `git restore`) to make Git usage more **user-friendly** and **less error-prone**, especially for beginners.

- `git checkout` is still available but does **too many things**: switching branches, restoring files, creating branches, etc.
- `git switch` is **just for branch navigation**.

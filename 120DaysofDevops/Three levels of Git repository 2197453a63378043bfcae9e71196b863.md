# Three levels of Git repository

Let’s break it down into three levels of Git repository setup: **local**, **shared/private**, and **global/public** — so you can see the big picture and make the best decisions.

---

## 🧩 1. **Local Git Repository (on your laptop)**

✅ What you’re doing:

- Run `git init` in your project folder.
- Everything stays on **your computer only**.
- Good for:
    - Testing
    - Personal experiments
    - Learning Git

⚠️ Limitation:

- Nobody else can see or collaborate.
- No remote backups.

🧠 Example:

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
cd ~/myproject
git init

```

---

## 🖥️ 2. **Private Git Server (in your office / on-prem)**

✅ You host a **bare Git repo** on a central server in your network:

- All developers can **clone**, **push**, and **pull** from that server.
- It acts like your **own GitHub**, but private.
- You can use:
    - SSH or HTTP access
    - Tools like GitLab CE (Community Edition), Gitea, or just a simple Git server

🧠 Setup example:

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
# On the server:
mkdir /git/repo.git
cd /git/repo.git
git init --bare

# On a developer’s laptop:
git clone ssh://user@yourserver.com:/git/repo.git

```

👍 Pros:

- Full control and privacy
- No internet needed (in local network)

⚠️ Cons:

- You must handle backup, security, user access
- Less scalable than cloud solutions

---

## 🌐 3. **Global Git Hosting (like GitHub)**

✅ Most popular way to **collaborate globally and reliably**.

Examples:

- **GitHub**
- GitLab.com
- Bitbucket
- Azure DevOps

🧠 Setup example:

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
# Create repo on GitHub
# Then on your laptop:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/project.git
git push -u origin main

```

👍 Pros:

- Globally accessible
- Automatic backups
- Issue tracking, pull requests, CI/CD, GitHub Actions
- Free for public repos (and private repos with limits)

⚠️ Cons:

- Your code is stored on someone else's cloud (consider this if it’s very confidential)

---

## 🧠 Summary Table:

| Level | Who Can Access | Internet Needed? | Good For |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Local Git | Only you | ❌ No | Personal projects, learning |
| Private Git Host | Your dev team only | ✅ Optional | Internal team collaboration |
| GitHub | Your team or world | ✅ Yes | Open source, remote collaboration |

---

## ✅ Recommendation for You:

Since you're learning and working toward real projects:

1. **Use local Git** for testing and practice.
2. **Push to GitHub** for real-world experience, collaboration, portfolio.
3. If your company wants private control, set up an **internal Git server** or **private GitHub repo**.

# Git Diff

### üîç `git diff` ‚Äî See What's Changed in Git

`git diff` is a **powerful tool** to show differences between:

- Your **working directory** and **staging area**
- Your **staging area** and the **last commit**
- Two **branches**, **commits**, or **files**

---

## ‚úÖ Common `git diff` Scenarios

### 1. **Unstaged Changes**

Shows what you‚Äôve changed but haven‚Äôt staged yet.

```bash
git diff

```

Example:

```diff
- old line
+ new line

```

---

### 2. **Staged vs. Last Commit**

Shows changes that are **staged** and ready to be committed.

```bash
git diff --cached
# or
git diff --staged

```

---

### 3. **Working Directory vs Last Commit**

Shows **all changes** (both staged and unstaged):

```bash
git diff HEAD

```

---

### 4. **Between Two Branches**

```bash
git diff main feature

```

Shows what‚Äôs different in `feature` vs `main`.

---

### 5. **Between Two Commits**

```bash
git diff abc123 def456

```

---

### 6. **Between a File's Versions**

```bash
git diff HEAD file.txt

```

Shows how `file.txt` has changed compared to the last commit.

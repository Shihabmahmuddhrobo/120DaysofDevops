# Git Pull vs Fork

---

### üîÅ 1. `git pull`

**What it does**:

`git pull` fetches and merges changes from a **remote repository** (usually `origin`) into your **local branch**.

**Basic syntax**:

```bash
git pull origin main

```

This:

- Fetches the latest changes from the `main` branch on `origin`.
- Merges them into your current local branch.

**When to use**:

- When you're collaborating and want to get the latest changes from others.
- Before pushing your own changes to ensure your branch is up to date.

### üç¥ 2. Forking (on GitHub or GitLab)

**What it is**:

A **fork** creates a **copy of someone else's repository** under your own GitHub account. It lets you make changes without affecting the original repository.

**Use case**:

- Used mainly in **open-source collaboration**.
- You fork a repo ‚Üí clone it locally ‚Üí make changes ‚Üí push to your fork ‚Üí create a **pull request** back to the original repo.

**Typical workflow**:

```bash
# Step 1: Fork on GitHub (via UI)
# Step 2: Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/their-repo.git

# Step 3: Add original repo as remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/originaluser/their-repo.git

# Step 4: Pull latest changes from original repo later
git pull upstream main

```

# Git Rebase -i HEAD~3

Great question! Let's break down:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3

```

into **simple words** so it’s easy to understand.

---

### ✅ What Does This Command Do?

- `git rebase`: You're telling Git you want to **rewrite history**.
- `i`: Means **interactive rebase** — you’ll get a chance to **edit, squash, delete, or reorder commits**.
- `HEAD~3`: Means "go back **3 commits** from the current one (HEAD)", and **start the rebase from there**.

So in plain English:

> “Hey Git, I want to interactively rewrite the last 3 commits.”
>

### 🧠 Why Would You Do This?

You might want to:

- Combine (squash) multiple commits into one.
- Change a commit message.
- Delete an unwanted commit.
- Reorder commits.

### 🖥️ What Happens After Running It?

When you run:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3

```

Git opens a text editor with something like:

```bash
pick a1b2c3 Commit message 1
pick d4e5f6 Commit message 2
pick g7h8i9 Commit message 3

```

You can change the word `pick` to:

| Action | What It Does |
| --- | --- |
| `pick` | Keep the commit as is |
| `reword` | Change the commit message |
| `edit` | Modify the commit content |
| `squash` | Combine this commit with the one above |
| `drop` | Delete the commit |

---

### 🧪 Example: Squash Commits

Let’s say your last 3 commits are small fixes and you want to squash them into one. You change it to:

```bash
pick a1b2c3 Add login page
squash d4e5f6 Fix typo
squash g7h8i9 Add button style

```

Then Git will let you write a **new combined commit message**.

---

### ⚠️ Reminder

- **Rewriting history** changes commit hashes.
- Only use `git rebase -i` on **local/private branches** — don’t rebase shared/public branches unless you know what you're doing.

### 🔚 Summary

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3

```

means:

> “Interactively edit the last 3 commits — change messages, squash them, delete them, or reorder them — however you like.”

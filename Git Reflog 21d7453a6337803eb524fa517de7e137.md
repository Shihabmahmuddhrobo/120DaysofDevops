# Git Reflog

### 🧠 What Is `git reflog`? (In Simple Words)

`git reflog` is like Git’s **black box flight recorder** — it keeps track of **where HEAD and branches pointed in the past**, even after you delete commits or reset branches.

In simple terms:

> git reflog shows a history of everything you've done in Git — even stuff that isn’t in your commit history anymore.

### 🔍 Why Is It Useful?

- You accidentally did `git reset --hard` and lost commits?
    
    👉 `git reflog` can help you recover them.
    
- You switched branches and forgot the old commit ID?
    
    👉 `git reflog` remembers it.
    
- You rebased and lost track of your changes?
    
    👉 `git reflog` can take you back.

### 🖥️ Example Output

```bash
git reflog

```

Might give you something like this:

```
8a9c123 HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to HEAD~1
1b2d456 HEAD@{1}: commit: Fix login bug
a1e3f89 HEAD@{2}: rebase -i (start): checkout main
c3d5e67 HEAD@{3}: commit (initial): Initial commit

```

Each line shows:

- The commit ID
- The HEAD reference and index (`HEAD@{0}`, `HEAD@{1}`, etc.)
- The Git action you took
- The message/description

### 🛠️ Use Case: Recover a Lost Commit

Let’s say you accidentally ran:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1

```

Now your latest commit is gone 😱

You can run:

```bash
git reflog

```

Find the commit ID before the reset, then recover it like this:

```bash
git checkout <commit-id>

```

Or move HEAD back:

```bash
git reset --hard <commit-id>

```

# Git Stash

---

## 🧰 What is `git stash`?

`git stash` lets you **save your uncommitted changes** (tracked files, optionally untracked or ignored files), so you can **switch branches or pull updates** without committing work-in-progress code.

Think of it like "pausing" your work.

---

## ✳️ Basic Workflow

```bash
# 1. Make some changes to your files

# 2. Stash the changes
git stash

# 3. Work on something else (e.g., checkout a different branch)

# 4. Come back and re-apply your stashed changes
git stash apply

```

---

## 🔍 What Gets Stashed?

By default:

- Changes to **tracked files** (both staged and unstaged)
- **Not included**: untracked files (unless explicitly added)

---

## 🧪 Example

```bash
echo "work in progress" >> file.txt
git stash

```

Now `git status` is clean — your changes are hidden.

To bring changes back:

```bash
git stash apply

```

## 📚 Useful `git stash` Commands

### 1. **`git stash`**

Stashes your current changes.

### 2. **`git stash list`**

Shows your stash stack:

```bash
stash@{0}: WIP on main: 1234abc Add feature
stash@{1}: WIP on main: 5678def Fix bug

```

### 3. **`git stash apply`**

Applies the latest stash (or specify one):

```bash
git stash apply stash@{1}

```

### 4. **`git stash pop`**

Applies **and deletes** the stash:

```bash
git stash pop stash@{0}

```

### 5. **`git stash drop stash@{0}`**

Deletes a specific stash without applying.

### 6. **`git stash clear`**

Deletes **all** stashes.

## 🔄 Including Untracked Files

By default, `git stash` ignores untracked files.

Use this to include them:

```bash
git stash -u  # or --include-untracked

```

To stash even ignored files:

```bash
git stash -a  # or --all

```

## 🧠 Use Cases

| Situation | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Need to switch branches but have uncommitted work | `git stash` → switch branch → `git stash apply` |
| Want to test something temporarily | Stash your WIP, test, then unstash |
| Accidentally made changes on the wrong branch | Stash, checkout correct branch, apply stash |

---

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

- If you run `git stash` multiple times, your stashes stack up — don't forget to `apply` or `pop` the right one.
- Conflicts can occur when applying a stash (just like merging).
- Applying a stash **doesn't remove it** unless you use `pop`.

---

## 📦 Bonus: Stash Named Work

Give your stash a message:

```bash
git stash push -m "WIP: login form"

```

View it with:

```bash
git stash list

```

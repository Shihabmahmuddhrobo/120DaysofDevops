# Git clone

## What is `git clone`?

`git clone` is used to **copy** an entire remote repository (e.g., from GitHub, GitLab) **into your computer** — including all files, commit history, branches, etc.

> Think of it like:
> 
> 
> 📥 "Download the whole project and turn it into a local Git repo I can work on."

## ✅ Basic Syntax

```bash

git clone <repository-url>

```

Example:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-project.git

```

This creates a new folder called `my-project` in your current directory.

---

## 🔄 What Happens When You Clone?

- A **local copy** of the code is created on your computer.
- Git automatically creates a **`.git`** folder to track changes.
- Git automatically adds a remote called **`origin`** (the GitHub repo).
- You are on the **default branch** (usually `main` or `master`).

---

## 💡 Example: Clone and Start Working

```bash

git clone https://github.com/openai/gym.git
cd gym
code .          # open in VS Code or your editor

```

Now you can:

- Edit code
- Create branches
- Commit
- Push changes back (if you have permission)

---

## 🛠 Optional: Custom Folder Name

You can rename the folder as you clone:

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
git clone https://github.com/openai/gym.git my-gym-project

```

Creates a folder `my-gym-project` instead of `gym`.

## 🔒 Private Repos

To clone a **private repository**, you need:

- Username + password/token
    
    **OR**
    
- SSH key access

Example (with SSH):

```bash

git clone git@github.com:yourusername/private-repo.git

```

| Task | Command Example |
| --- | --- |
| Clone public repo | `git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git` |
| Clone into custom folder | `git clone URL folder-name` |
| Clone private repo (SSH) | `git clone git@github.com:user/repo.git` |
| Check remotes after cloning | `git remote -v` (you’ll see `origin` is already set) |

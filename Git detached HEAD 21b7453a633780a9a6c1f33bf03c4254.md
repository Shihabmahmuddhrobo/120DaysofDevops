# Git detached HEAD

### üß† What does ‚Äú**detached HEAD**‚Äù mean in Git?

In Git, a **detached HEAD** means you're **not currently on any branch**. Instead, you are directly pointing to a specific **commit**.

---

### üìå HEAD in Git

- `HEAD` is a pointer to your **current branch‚Äôs latest commit**.
- Normally, `HEAD` points to a branch name like:
    
    ```
    HEAD -> main
    
    ```
    

But in a **detached HEAD** state, it points to a specific commit instead:

```
HEAD -> a1b2c3d (a commit hash)

```

---

### üîç When does this happen?

You enter a detached HEAD state when you do something like:

```bash
git checkout a1b2c3d

```

or

```bash
git switch --detach a1b2c3d

```

You're now looking at the project as it was at that specific commit, **not attached to any branch**.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why is this a problem?

If you make changes and commit in a detached HEAD state:

- The commit exists, but it's **not associated with any branch**.
- If you switch to another branch, those changes may become unreachable and lost unless you manually create a branch first.

---

### ‚úÖ How to safely work from detached HEAD

### 1. Commit something while detached:

```bash
git commit -am "hotfix test"

```

### 2. Then save it by creating a branch:

```bash
git switch -c hotfix-from-detached

```

Now your commit is safely part of a new branch.

---

### üßπ How to get out of detached HEAD

To go back to a normal branch:

```bash
git switch main

```

or

```bash
git checkout main  # old style

```

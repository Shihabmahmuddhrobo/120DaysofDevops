# Git http vs ssh

## Git over **HTTP/HTTPS** vs **SSH**

| Feature | HTTPS | SSH |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🔐 Authentication | Username + password or personal access token (PAT) | SSH key pair (private/public) |
| 👨‍💻 Usage | Easier to start for beginners | Preferred by advanced users |
| 🔒 Security | Secure (with token) | Secure (uses cryptographic keys) |
| 🔁 Convenience | You enter username/token every time (or store it) | No password needed after setup |
| 🌐 Network | Works behind most firewalls | Might need open port 22 (sometimes blocked) |

## 📥 Example: Git Clone with HTTPS

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
git clone https://github.com/yourname/myproject.git

```

On push/pull, you’ll need to enter:

- your **GitHub username**, and
- a **personal access token** (since password is no longer allowed)

## 🔐 Example: Git Clone with SSH

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
git clone git@github.com:yourname/myproject.git

```

SSH requires that:

- You have an SSH key pair (`~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`)
- Your **public key** is added to your GitHub/GitLab account
- Now you can push/pull without entering credentials every time

## ✅ When to Use HTTPS

- You're new to Git and want quick setup
- You're on a shared machine
- You can't use SSH due to firewall/port issues

## ✅ When to Use SSH

- You're working regularly with Git
- You want to avoid typing tokens every time
- You’re using automation scripts (CI/CD)
- You want better security and convenience

## 🧠 Summary Table

| Protocol | Setup Needed | Login Required Each Time | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HTTPS | None or token | Yes (unless stored) | Beginners / Quick use |
| SSH | SSH keys setup | No | Regular developers |

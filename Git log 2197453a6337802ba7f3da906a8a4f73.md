# Git log

## âœ… `git log`

This command shows the **commit history** of your Git project â€” starting from the most recent commit.

When you type:

```bash
git log

```

You will see a list of commits like this:

```
commit 92aeb75f60f1c4e64bb2c9b5f4d8abac67123456
Author: Alice Dev <alice@example.com>
Date:   Sat Jun 21 12:34:56 2025 +0300

    Added login form

commit d32a5cafe7f0c9b2abaf7b2f2fd3aeaf78123456
Author: Bob Dev <bob@example.com>
Date:   Fri Jun 20 15:21:43 2025 +0300

    Fixed bug in dashboard

```

Each commit shows:

- **Commit hash** (unique ID)
- **Author** (who made the change)
- **Date** (when it was made)
- **Message** (summary of what was done)

---

## ðŸ”¢ `git log -2`

This command **limits the number of commits shown**.

```bash
git log -2

```

This will show **only the last 2 commits**, not the entire history.

You can change the number:

- `git log -1` â†’ show last 1 commit
- `git log -5` â†’ show last 5 commits

---

## ðŸ§  Summary Table

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `git log` | Show full commit history |
| `git log -1` | Show only the most recent commit |
| `git log -2` | Show last 2 commits |
| `git log -n` | Show last `n` commits |

---

## ðŸ’¡ Extra Tip: Make `git log` easier to read

Try:

```bash
git log --oneline

```

This shows commit hashes and messages in one line:

```
92aeb75 Added login form
d32a5ca Fixed bug in dashboard

```

Want a visual log?

```bash
git log --oneline --graph --all

```

This gives a tree-like view of your branches and merges.

## `git log --pretty=oneline`

- This uses the **full (long) commit hash**, not short.
- Itâ€™s slightly longer and more raw.

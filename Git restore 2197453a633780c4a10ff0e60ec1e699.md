# Git restore

## 🧠 What is `git restore`?

`git restore` is used to **undo changes** in your working directory or staged area (index) **without deleting commits**.

> 🛑 It does NOT undo commits. It only works with files you are still editing, not yet committed.

## 📦 Two Main Use Cases

| Task | Command example |
| --- | --- |
| Undo changes in working directory | `git restore file.txt` |
| Unstage a file (keep changes) | `git restore --staged file.txt` |

---

## ✅ Example 1: Undo Changes in a File

Imagine you edited `main.py` but want to discard your changes:

```bash
git restore main.py

```

🔁 This replaces `main.py` with the version from the last commit — discards your edits.

> ⚠️ Changes are lost. No recovery unless you saved them elsewhere.
>

## ✅ Example 2: Unstage a File (but keep edits)

Suppose you ran:

```bash
git add login.html

```

Then you realize you don’t want it staged yet:

```bash
git restore --staged login.html

```

Now:

- `login.html` is no longer staged
- Your changes are still in the file (not lost)

---

## ✅ Example 3: Undo All Changes in Directory

```bash
git restore .

```

- This resets all files in the working directory (not staged or committed yet)

Add `--staged` to remove all from staging too:

```bash
git restore --staged .

```

---

## 🚫 Not for Committed Changes

`git restore` does **not** undo committed changes. For that, use:

- `git revert` (to undo commits safely)
- `git reset` (to move commit pointer, advanced)

---

## 🧪 Summary Table

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Discard edits in file | `git restore file.txt` |
| Unstage a file | `git restore --staged file.txt` |
| Restore all changes | `git restore .` |
| Unstage all files | `git restore --staged .` |
| Restore both staged & unstaged | `git restore --source=HEAD --staged --worktree file.txt` |

---

## ✅ Real-Life Tip:

- Use `git status` to see what’s staged or modified
- Then choose `git restore` or `git restore --staged` as needed

A **runbook** (or **run book**) is a detailed set of instructions or procedures that IT, DevOps, or operations teams use to **handle specific tasks, processes, or incidents** in a system or network environment.

* **Routine maintenance:** How to restart services, back up databases, apply patches.
* **Deployment procedures:** How to roll out new code or configuration changes.
* **Onboarding:** How to set up a new employee or server.

# Token

A token is more formally defined as a sequence of characters that is considered as a single unit by

the shell.

Metacharacter:
I

&
;

()

<>

space, tab, and newline

+Words are defined as tokens that do not contain any unquoted matter characters, operators, on the other hand, are tokens that contain at least one unquoted metal character.

Let me point out that there are two types of operators.

There are control operators and there are redirection operators.
